Project description: Our project idea is to create a database containing the definition of a list of words that's displayed on the side of the webpage. The user has to input a word and the website either responds with the word and the definition on the display area or outputs a text that says that the definition of the word is not available at the database. The goal of this project is to create a web app that gives the user definition of a set list of words (25 words). The requirements for this project are: 


•	Users can view the list of words available to define on the side of the webpage.
•	Users input a word into a textbox above which the web page asks “what do you need defined?”.
•	The definition is displayed on a “display area” along with the word defined. 
•	 If the word is not listed in the database a message in the “display area” will note that the webpage does not contain the definition of the word.



Dictionary:
When a word is entered the system will generate its:
•	Definition
•	Synonyms
•	Usage
•	Part of speech
•	Category

	Firstly, the user will be asked to sign in (if already has an account) or sign up (if user does not have an account.
	After signing in the screen displays the home page of the dictionary.
	Here we can find the profile, word meanings, and others
	On clicking on “word meanings” the system asks the user to enter the word of his choice.
	The user enters the word and submits. It displays the definition and other details as mentioned above.
	Now the user can sign out after using the dictionary.
